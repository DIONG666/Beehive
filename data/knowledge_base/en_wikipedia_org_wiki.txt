[![Image 27: Titan beetle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Titanus_giganteus_MHNT.jpg/500px-Titanus_giganteus_MHNT.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Titanus_giganteus_MHNT.jpg "Titan beetle")
The **[titan beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_beetle "Titan beetle")** (_Titanus giganteus_) is a [Neotropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotropical_realm "Neotropical realm") species of [longhorn beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longhorn_beetle "Longhorn beetle"). It is one of the largest known [beetles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle "Beetle"), as well as one of the largest known insects, at more than 170 millimetres (6.7 inches) in length. Adult titan beetles only live for a few weeks, and protect themselves from predators with their sharp spines and powerful jaws. The species is native to [tropical rainforests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest "Tropical rainforest") throughout South America, primarily the [Amazon rainforest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest "Amazon rainforest"), and is primarily found in [old-growth forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-growth_forest "Old-growth forest") with plenty of rotting wood, which serves as their principal food supply. Despite a broad distribution throughout South America, it is secretive and rarely seen due to its [nocturnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality "Nocturnality") habits and cryptic behavior. These three male titan beetles, collected in [French Guiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana "French Guiana"), are in the collection of the [Muséum de Toulouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9um_de_Toulouse "Muséum de Toulouse") in France.
