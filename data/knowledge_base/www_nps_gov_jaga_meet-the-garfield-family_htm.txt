Meet the Garfield Family
========================

Who is the Garfield family? Abram Garfield was one of the first men who helped dig the Ohio and Erie Canal. Eliza Ballou spent her life raising her four children alone after her husband's death. Mehetable and Mary both worked on the farm along with their mother and helped raised their siblings. Thomas was the oldest son who also helped on the family farm but then ventured out into the world because he wanted land of his own. What importance do they have at James A. Garfield National Historic Site? They are the parents and siblings of the 20th President of the United States, James A. Garfield, and they all helped shape him into the man and future president he would become.
