Since the office was established in 1789, 45 individuals have served as [president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States").[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-1) Of these, eight have died in office,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-2) of whom four were [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassinated "Assassinated") and four died of natural causes. In each of these instances, the [vice president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States "Vice President of the United States") has succeeded to the presidency. This practice is now governed by [Section One of the Twenty-fifth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution") to the [United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution "United States Constitution"), [ratified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification "Ratification") in 1967, which declares that, "the Vice President shall become President" if the president is removed from office, dies, or resigns.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-CRSreport2004-3) The initial authorization for this practice was provided by [Article II, Section 1, Clause 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_6:_Vacancy_and_disability "Article Two of the United States Constitution"), of the U.S. Constitution.[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-4)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-CRSreport2004-3)

The first incumbent U.S. president to die was [William Henry Harrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison "William Henry Harrison"), on April 4, 1841, only one month after [Inauguration Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration "United States presidential inauguration"). He died from complications of what at the time was believed to be [pneumonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia "Pneumonia").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-5) The second U.S. president to die in office, [Zachary Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Taylor "Zachary Taylor"), died on July 9, 1850, from acute [gastroenteritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis "Gastroenteritis").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-6)[Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln "Abraham Lincoln") was the third U.S. president to die in office, and was the first to be assassinated. He [was shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln "Assassination of Abraham Lincoln") by [John Wilkes Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkes_Booth "John Wilkes Booth") on the night of April 14, 1865, and died the following morning.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-7) Sixteen years later, on July 2, 1881, [James A. Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Garfield "James A. Garfield")[was shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_James_A._Garfield "Assassination of James A. Garfield") by [Charles J. Guiteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_J._Guiteau "Charles J. Guiteau"), surviving for 79 days before dying on September 19, 1881.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-8)

On September 14, 1901, [William McKinley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McKinley "William McKinley") died, eight days after [being shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_William_McKinley "Assassination of William McKinley") by [Leon Czolgosz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Czolgosz "Leon Czolgosz").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-McKinley-9) Next, [Warren G. Harding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_G._Harding "Warren G. Harding") suffered a heart attack, and died on August 2, 1923.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-10) On April 12, 1945, [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt") (who had just begun his fourth term in office) collapsed and died as a result of a [cerebral hemorrhage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage "Cerebral hemorrhage").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-11) The most recent U.S. president to die in office was [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "John F. Kennedy"), who [was shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy "Assassination of John F. Kennedy") by [Lee Harvey Oswald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald "Lee Harvey Oswald") on November 22, 1963, in [Dallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas "Dallas"), Texas.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-12)

1841: William Henry Harrison
----------------------------

On March 26, 1841, [William Henry Harrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison "William Henry Harrison") became ill with a cold after being caught in a torrential downpour without cover. His symptoms grew progressively worse over the ensuing two days, at which time a team of doctors was called in to treat him.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-Jones31Day-13) After making a diagnosis of right lower lobe [pneumonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia "Pneumonia"), they proceeded to place [heated suction cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupping_therapy "Cupping therapy") on his bare torso and to administer a series of [bloodlettings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting "Bloodletting"), to supposedly draw out the disease.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-WHHDOTP-14) When those procedures failed to bring about improvement, the doctors treated him with [ipecac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrup_of_ipecac "Syrup of ipecac"), [Castor oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_oil "Castor oil"), [calomel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calomel "Calomel"), and finally with a boiled mixture of crude [petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum "Petroleum") and [Virginia snakeroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristolochia_serpentaria "Aristolochia serpentaria"). All this only weakened Harrison further.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-Jones31Day-13)

Initially, no official announcement was made concerning Harrison's illness, which, the longer he remained out of public view, fueled public speculation and concern. By the end of the month large crowds were gathering outside the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House"), holding vigil while awaiting any news about the president's condition.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-Jones31Day-13) On the evening of April 4, 1841, nine days after becoming ill,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-15) and exactly one month after [his inauguration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_William_Henry_Harrison "Inauguration of William Henry Harrison"), Harrison died at age 68.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-WHHDOTP-14) His last words were to his attending doctor, though assumed to be directed at [Vice President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States "Vice President of the United States")[John Tyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyler "John Tyler"):

> Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-16)

A 30-day period of [mourning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mourning "Mourning") commenced following the president's death. Various public ceremonies, modeled after European royal funeral practices, were held. An invitation-only funeral service was also held, on April 7, in the [East Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Room "East Room") of the White House, after which Harrison's coffin was brought to [Congressional Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Cemetery "Congressional Cemetery") in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."), where it was placed in a temporary receiving vault.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-17)

That June, Harrison's body was transported by train and river [barge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barge "Barge") to [North Bend, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bend,_Ohio "North Bend, Ohio"). Then, on July 7, 1841, the nation's 9th president was buried in a family tomb at the summit of Mt. Nebo, overlooking the [Ohio River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_River "Ohio River")– the [William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison_Tomb_State_Memorial "William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-18)

Harrison's death sparked a brief [constitutional crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis "Constitutional crisis") regarding [succession to the presidency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession "United States presidential line of succession"), as the [U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Constitution "U.S. Constitution") was unclear as to whether Vice President Tyler should assume the office of president or merely execute the duties of the vacant office as [acting president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_President_of_the_United_States "Acting President of the United States"). Tyler claimed a constitutional mandate to carry out the full powers and duties of the presidency and took the [presidential oath of office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office_of_the_president_of_the_United_States "Oath of office of the president of the United States"), setting an important precedent for an orderly transfer of presidential power when a president leaves office intra-term.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-19)

Coincidentally, all but one of the presidents who later died in office had, like Harrison, won a presidential election in a year ending in a zero (1840 through 1960). This pattern of tragedies came to be known as the [Curse of Tippecanoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Tippecanoe "Curse of Tippecanoe"), or the Curse of [Tecumseh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecumseh "Tecumseh"), the name of the [Shawnee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee "Shawnee") leader against whom Harrison fought in the 1811 [Battle of Tippecanoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tippecanoe "Battle of Tippecanoe"). Also sometimes referred to as the _Zero Factor_ legend, the pattern was disrupted by [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan"), who survived an [assassination attempt in 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan") (69 days after taking office) and lived to complete two full terms.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-20)

Print depicting the death of Zachary Taylor

[Zachary Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Taylor "Zachary Taylor") was known to have consumed copious amounts of ice water, cold milk, green apples, and cherries on July 4, 1850, after attending holiday celebrations and the laying of the cornerstone of the [Washington Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument "Washington Monument").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-21) That same evening, he became severely ill with an unknown digestive ailment. Doctors used popular treatments of the time. On the morning of July 9, the president asked his wife [Margaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Taylor "Margaret Taylor") not to grieve saying:

> I have always done my duty, I am ready to die. My only regret is for the friends I leave behind me.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-ZTDOTP-22)

Taylor died late that evening, five days after becoming ill, at age 65.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-23) Contemporary reports listed the cause of death as "[bilious diarrhea or a bilious cholera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis "Gastroenteritis")."[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-24) He was succeeded by Vice President [Millard Fillmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millard_Fillmore "Millard Fillmore").

Taylor's funeral took place on July 13,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-ZTDOTP-22) and like Harrison's nine years earlier, was held in the East Room of the White House.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-25) Afterward, an estimated 100,000 people gathered along the funeral route[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-ZTDOTP-22) to Congressional Cemetery where his coffin was placed temporarily in the Public Vault; that October it was transported to [Louisville, Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky "Louisville, Kentucky"). On November 1, 1850, Taylor was buried in his family's burial ground on the Taylor estate, _Springfield_, which became the [Zachary Taylor National Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Taylor_National_Cemetery "Zachary Taylor National Cemetery").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-26)

Almost immediately after his death, rumors began to circulate that he had been poisoned by [pro-slavery Southerners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States"), and various [conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory "Conspiracy theory") persisted into the late-20th century.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-27) The cause of Taylor's death was definitively established in 1991, when his remains were exhumed and an autopsy conducted by [Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky "Kentucky")'s chief [medical examiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner "Coroner"). Subsequent [neutron activation analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation_analysis "Neutron activation analysis") conducted at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory "Oak Ridge National Laboratory") revealed no evidence of poisoning, as [arsenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic "Arsenic") levels were too low.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-28)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-29) The analysis concluded Taylor had contracted cholera morbus (acute [gastroenteritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis "Gastroenteritis")), as Washington had open sewers, and his food or drink may have been contaminated.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-30)

1865: Abraham Lincoln

The [assassination of Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln "Assassination of Abraham Lincoln") took place on [Good Friday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday "Good Friday"), April 14, 1865, as the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War") was drawing to a close. He died the following morning at the age of 56. The assassination occurred five days after General [Robert E. Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee "Robert E. Lee") and the [Army of Northern Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Northern_Virginia "Army of Northern Virginia") surrendered to General [Ulysses S. Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant "Ulysses S.

The assassination of President Lincoln was planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor [John Wilkes Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkes_Booth "John Wilkes Booth"), a [Confederate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America "Confederate States of America") sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and a strong opponent of the [abolition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States "Abolitionism in the United States") of [slavery in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-34) Booth and a group of co-conspirators originally plotted to kidnap Lincoln, but later planned to kill him, Vice President [Andrew Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Johnson "Andrew Johnson"), and Secretary of State [William H.

Seward") in a bid to help the Confederacy's cause.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-35) Johnson's would-be-assassin, [George Atzerodt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Atzerodt "George Atzerodt") did not carry out his part of the plan, and Johnson succeeded Lincoln as president while [Lewis Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Powell_(conspirator) "Lewis Powell (conspirator)") only managed to wound Seward.

Lincoln was shot once in the back of his head while watching the play _[Our American Cousin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our\_American\_Cousin "Our American Cousin")_ with his wife [Mary Todd Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Todd_Lincoln "Mary Todd Lincoln") at [Ford's Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%27s_Theatre "Ford's Theatre") in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."), on the night of April 14, 1865.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-36) An army surgeon who happened to be at Ford's, Doctor [Charles Leale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leale "Charles Leale"), assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-37) The unconscious president was then carried across the street from the theater to the [Petersen House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersen_House "Petersen House"), where he remained in a coma for eight hours before dying the following morning.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-38)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-39)

Within two weeks of the manhunt for Lincoln's killers, on April 26, 1865, Booth and [David Herold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Herold "David Herold") were caught in a [tobacco barn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_barn "Tobacco barn") in [Port Conway, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Conway,_Virginia "Port Conway, Virginia"). While Herold surrendered, Booth was shot to death by [Boston Corbett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Corbett "Boston Corbett"), a Union Corporal.

A [three-week series of official functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_and_burial_of_Abraham_Lincoln "Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln") were held following the president's death. He lay in state in the East Room of the White House which was open to the public on April 18. A funeral service was held the next day, and then the coffin was transported in a procession down [Pennsylvania Avenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Avenue "Pennsylvania Avenue") to the [United States Capitol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol "United States Capitol"), where a ceremonial burial service was held in the [rotunda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_rotunda "United States Capitol rotunda"). After lying in state at the Capitol, Lincoln's remains were transported by train to [Springfield, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Illinois "Springfield, Illinois"), for burial. He was interred on May 4, 1865, at [Oak Ridge Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge_Cemetery "Oak Ridge Cemetery") in Springfield– the [Lincoln Tomb State Historic Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Tomb "Lincoln Tomb") since 1895.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-40)

1881: James A. Garfield
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 1881: James A. Garfield")]

[![Image 13: A black-and-white drawing of a crowd of people, some of whom are angry, the two foremost of whom are bearded and wearing top hats](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Garfield_assassination_engraving_cropped.jpg/330px-Garfield_assassination_engraving_cropped.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Garfield_assassination_engraving_cropped.jpg)

An engraving, published in _[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank\_Leslie%27s\_Illustrated\_Newspaper "Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper")_, of President [Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Garfield "James A. Garfield") after being shot by [Charles J. Guiteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_J._Guiteau "Charles J. Guiteau"); Secretary of State [James G. Blaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_G._Blaine "James G. Blaine") is with the president.

The [assassination of James A. Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_James_A._Garfield "Assassination of James A. Garfield") happened in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."), on July 2, 1881. Garfield was shot by [Charles J. Guiteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_J._Guiteau "Charles J. Guiteau") at 9:30 a.m., less than four months into his term as the nation's 20th president. He died 11 weeks later on September 19, 1881, at the age of 49. Vice President [Chester A. Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_A._Arthur "Chester A. Arthur") succeeded him as president. Garfield was scheduled to leave Washington on July 2, 1881, for his summer vacation.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-41) On that day, Guiteau lay in wait for the president at the [Baltimore and Potomac Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_and_Potomac_Railroad "Baltimore and Potomac Railroad") station, on the southwest corner of present-day [Sixth Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6th_Street_(Washington,_D.C.) "6th Street (Washington, D.C.)") and [Constitution Avenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Avenue "Constitution Avenue") NW, [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.")[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-42)

President Garfield came to the Sixth Street Station on his way to his [alma mater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_mater "Alma mater"), [Williams College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_College "Williams College"), where he was scheduled to deliver a speech. Garfield was accompanied by two of his sons, [James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rudolph_Garfield "James Rudolph Garfield") and [Harry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Augustus_Garfield "Harry Augustus Garfield"), and [Secretary of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State "United States Secretary of State")[James G. Blaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_G._Blaine "James G. Blaine"). [Secretary of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War "United States Secretary of War")[Robert Todd Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Todd_Lincoln "Robert Todd Lincoln") waited at the station to see the president off.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-43) Garfield had no bodyguard or security detail; with the exception of Abraham Lincoln during the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Civil_War "United States Civil War"), early U.S. presidents never used any guards.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-44)

As President Garfield entered the waiting room of the station, Guiteau stepped forward and pulled the trigger from behind at point-blank range. "My God, what is that?!" Garfield cried out, flinging up his arms. Guiteau fired again and Garfield collapsed.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-45) One bullet grazed Garfield's shoulder; the other hit him in the back, passing the first [lumbar vertebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae "Lumbar vertebrae") but missing the [spinal cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord "Spinal cord") before coming to rest behind his pancreas.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-46)

Garfield, conscious but in [shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory) "Shock (circulatory)"), was carried to an upstairs floor of the train station.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-47) Lincoln sent for [D.C. Bliss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Willard_Bliss "Doctor Willard Bliss"), a prominent Washington physician, who soon arrived and examined Garfield's wounds several times, probing for the bullet that remained lodged in the president's body with his fingers and metal probes. Two additional doctors were summoned, and they also probed the entry wound. Eventually there were about twenty people in the room, including at least ten physicians.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-48) As Garfield was being cared for, Lincoln, thinking back to the death of his father, said "How many hours of sorrow I have passed in this town."[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-49)

Garfield was carried back to the White House. Although doctors told him that he would not survive the night, the president remained conscious and alert.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-50) The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-51) A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-52)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-53) His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-54)

Garfield had been a regular visitor to the shore town of [Long Branch, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Branch,_New_Jersey "Long Branch, New Jersey"), one of the nation's premier summer vacation spots until World War I. In early September, it was decided to bring him to [Elberon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elberon,_New_Jersey "Elberon, New Jersey"), a quiet beach town just to the south of Long Branch, in hopes that the beach air would help him recover. When they heard that the president was being brought to their town, local citizens built more than half a mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly to the door of the oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Road identifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950. Throughout the five-month drama, anxious Americans across the country were kept informed of developments by the [news media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media "News media"). The publisher of _[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank\_Leslie%27s\_Illustrated\_Newspaper "Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper")_, [Miriam Leslie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Leslie "Miriam Leslie"), was especially quick to publish fully illustrated accounts of key moments, from Garfield's shooting to the embalming of his body.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-55)

Chester Arthur was at his home in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") on the night of September 19, when word came that Garfield had died. After first getting the news, Arthur said "I hope—my God, I do hope it is a mistake." But confirmation by telegram came soon after. Arthur took the presidential oath of office, administered by a [New York Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court "New York Supreme Court") judge, then left for Long Branch to pay his respects before traveling on to Washington.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-56) Garfield's body was taken to Washington, where it lay in state for two days in the Capitol Rotunda before being taken to [Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland "Cleveland"), where the funeral was held on September 26.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-57)

When the tracks that had been hastily built to the Franklyn cottage were later torn up, actor Oliver Byron bought the wooden ties, and had local carpenter William Presley build them into a small tea house, in commemoration of the president. The red & white (originally red, white & blue) "Garfield Tea House" still survives, resting a couple of blocks away from the site of the cottage on the grounds of the Long Branch Historical Museum, a former Episcopal Church. The church is nicknamed "The Church of the Presidents," as it had been attended by, in addition to Garfield, presidents Chester A. Arthur, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Rutherford Hayes, William McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson, during their own visits to Long Branch.

A drawing depicting [Leon Czolgosz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Czolgosz "Leon Czolgosz") shooting William McKinley with a concealed revolver

[William McKinley was assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_William_McKinley "Assassination of William McKinley") on September 6, 1901, inside the [Temple of Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Music "Temple of Music") on the grounds of the [Pan-American Exposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-American_Exposition "Pan-American Exposition") in [Buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York "Buffalo, New York"), New York. [McKinley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McKinley "William McKinley") was shaking hands with the public when [Leon Czolgosz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Czolgosz "Leon Czolgosz"), a Polish-American [anarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist "Anarchist"), shot him. The 58-year-old president died eight days later on September 14 from [gangrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangrene "Gangrene") caused by the bullet wounds.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-McKinley-9)

McKinley had been [elected for a second term in 1900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_United_States_presidential_election "1900 United States presidential election").[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-58) He enjoyed meeting the public, and was reluctant to accept the security available to his office.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-59) The [secretary to the president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_to_the_President_of_the_United_States "Secretary to the President of the United States"), [George B. Cortelyou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Cortelyou "George B. Cortelyou"), feared an [assassination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination "Assassination") attempt would take place during a visit to the Temple of Music, and twice took it off the schedule. McKinley restored it each time.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-60)

Czolgosz had lost his job during the economic [Panic of 1893](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893 "Panic of 1893") and turned to [anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism"), a political philosophy whose adherents had previously killed foreign leaders.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-61) Regarding McKinley as a symbol of oppression, Czolgosz felt it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-62) Unable to get near McKinley during the earlier part of the presidential visit, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-McKinley-9)

McKinley initially appeared to be recovering, but took a turn for the worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous, and died early the next morning; Vice President [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt") succeeded him. Roosevelt was hiking near the top of [Mt. Marcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Marcy "Mt. Marcy"), in [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state) "New York (state)")'s [Adirondack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondacks "Adirondacks") region, when a runner located him to convey the news.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-63) After McKinley's murder, for which Czolgosz was put to death in the [electric chair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_chair "Electric chair"), the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") passed legislation to officially charge the [Secret Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service "United States Secret Service") with the responsibility for protecting the president.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-64)

1923: Warren G. Harding
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: 1923: Warren G. Harding")]

Warren G. Harding's horse-drawn casket in front of the [North Portico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Lawn_(White_House) "North Lawn (White House)") of the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House")

[Warren G. Harding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_G._Harding "Warren G. Harding") died from a sudden heart attack in his hotel suite while visiting [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco "San Francisco") on the evening of August 2, 1923, at the age of 57. His death quickly led to theories that he had been poisoned[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-65) or committed suicide. Rumors of poisoning were fueled, in part, by a book called _The Strange Death of President Harding_ by private detective and former [Ohio Gang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Gang "Ohio Gang") member [Gaston Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Means "Gaston Means"), who suggested [First Lady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_lady_of_the_United_States "First lady of the United States")[Florence Harding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Harding "Florence Harding") had poisoned her husband after learning of his infidelity. Mrs. Harding's refusal to allow an autopsy on President Harding only added to the speculation. According to the physicians attending Harding, however, the symptoms in the days prior to his death all pointed to [congestive heart failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestive_heart_failure "Congestive heart failure"). Harding's biographer, Samuel H. Adams, concluded that "Warren G. Harding died a natural death which, in any case, could not have been long postponed."[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-66)

Immediately after President Harding's death, Mrs. Harding returned to [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."), and briefly stayed in the White House with the new president [Calvin Coolidge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge "Calvin Coolidge") and first lady. For a month, former first lady Harding gathered and destroyed by fire President Harding's correspondence and documents, both official and unofficial. Upon her return to [Marion, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion,_Ohio "Marion, Ohio"), Mrs. Harding hired a number of secretaries to collect and burn President Harding's personal papers. According to Mrs. Harding, she took these actions to protect her husband's legacy. The remaining papers were held and kept from public view by the _Harding Memorial Association_ in Marion.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-67)

1945: Franklin D. Roosevelt
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: 1945: Franklin D. Roosevelt")]

[![Image 16: A black-and-white photograph of a wagon being drawn and accompanied by seven white horses, some of which are being ridden by people](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Franklin_Roosevelt_funeral_procession_1945.jpg/250px-Franklin_Roosevelt_funeral_procession_1945.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Franklin_Roosevelt_funeral_procession_1945.jpg)

Franklin D. Roosevelt's horse-drawn casket proceeds down [Pennsylvania Avenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Avenue_(Washington,_D.C.) "Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)")

On March 29, 1945, [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt") went to the [Little White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_White_House "Little White House") in [Warm Springs, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm_Springs,_Georgia "Warm Springs, Georgia"), to rest before his anticipated appearance at the [founding conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_International_Organization "United Nations Conference on International Organization") of the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") in late April in San Francisco. At around 1:00 pm on April 12, Roosevelt said, "I have a terrific pain in the back of my head," which were his last words. He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president's attending cardiologist, [Howard Bruenn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Bruenn "Howard Bruenn"), diagnosed a massive [cerebral hemorrhage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage "Cerebral hemorrhage") (stroke).[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-68) The 63-year-old Roosevelt died a few hours later, without regaining consciousness. As [Allen Drury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Drury "Allen Drury") later said, "so ended an era, and so began another." After Roosevelt's death, an editorial in _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_York\_Times "The New York Times")_ declared, "Men will thank God on their knees a hundred years from now that Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House."[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-69)

In his later years at the White House, when Roosevelt was increasingly overworked, his daughter [Anna Roosevelt Boettiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Roosevelt_Halsted "Anna Roosevelt Halsted") had moved in to provide her father companionship and support. Anna had also arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, the then widowed [Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Page_Mercer_Rutherfurd "Lucy Page Mercer Rutherfurd"). A close friend of both Roosevelt and Mercer who was present, [Elizabeth Shoumatoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Shoumatoff "Elizabeth Shoumatoff"), rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. When [Eleanor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt "Eleanor Roosevelt") heard about her husband's death, she was also faced with the news that Anna had been arranging these meetings with Mercer and that Mercer had been with Franklin when he died.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-70)

On the morning of April 13, Roosevelt's body was placed in a flag-draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train. After a White House funeral on April 14, Roosevelt was transported back to [Hyde Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_New_York "Hyde Park, New York") by train, guarded by four servicemen, one each from the [Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "United States Army"), [Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy"), [Marines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps "United States Marine Corps"), and [Coast Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard "United States Coast Guard"). As was his wish, Roosevelt was buried in the Rose Garden of the [Springwood estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_of_Franklin_D._Roosevelt_National_Historic_Site "Home of Franklin D.

Eleanor died in November 1962 and was buried next to him.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-71)

Roosevelt's death was met with shock and grief[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-72) across the U.S. and around the world. His declining health had not been known to the general public. Roosevelt had been president for more than 12 years, longer than any other person, and had led the country through some of its greatest crises to the impending defeat of [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") and within sight of the defeat of [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan") as well.

Less than a month after his death, on May 8, the [war in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_theatre_of_World_War_II "European theatre of World War II") ended. President [Harry S. Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. Truman") dedicated [Victory in Europe Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day "Victory in Europe Day") and its celebrations to Roosevelt's memory, and kept the flags across the U.S. at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period. In doing so, Truman said that his only wish was "that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day."[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-73)

1963: John F. Kennedy

President [Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "John F. Kennedy") and [Jackie Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis "Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis") (seated rear) with Governor [Connally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Connally "John Connally") and [Nellie Connally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Connally "Nellie Connally") (seated forward) in the [presidential limousine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_state_car_(United_States) "Presidential state car (United States)") minutes before the [assassination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy "Assassination of John F. Kennedy")

The most recent U.S. president to die in office is [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "John F. Kennedy"), who [was assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy "Assassination of John F. Kennedy") on November 22, 1963, in [Dallas, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas,_Texas "Dallas, Texas"). He was fatally shot by [Lee Harvey Oswald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald "Lee Harvey Oswald"), who fired three shots from a sixth floor window of the [Texas School Book Depository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_School_Book_Depository "Texas School Book Depository") at 12:30 p.m. as the presidential motorcade passed through [Dealey Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dealey_Plaza "Dealey Plaza"). Riding in the vehicle with the president were First Lady [Jackie Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis "Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis"), Texas governor [John Connally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Connally "John Connally"), and Connally's wife [Nellie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Connally "Nellie Connally"); Governor Connally was also seriously wounded in the attack. The motorcade rushed to [Parkland Memorial Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkland_Memorial_Hospital "Parkland Memorial Hospital"), where Kennedy was pronounced dead about 30 minutes later, at the age of 46. Connally recovered from his injuries.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-JFKhistory-74)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-JFKDOTP-75)

Vice President [Lyndon B. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson "Lyndon B. Johnson"), who was a few cars behind the president in the motorcade, became U.S. president upon Kennedy's death. He took the presidential oath of office onboard [Air Force One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One "Air Force One") as it sat on the runway at [Dallas Love Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Love_Field "Dallas Love Field"). Oswald was arrested by the [Dallas Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Police_Department "Dallas Police Department") that afternoon, and was charged under Texas state law with the murder of Kennedy, as well as that of Dallas policeman [J.D. Tippit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Tippit "J. D. Tippit"), who had been fatally shot a short time after the assassination. Two days later, on November 24, 1963, as live television cameras were covering his transfer from the city jail to the county jail, Oswald was fatally shot in the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters by Dallas nightclub operator [Jack Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ruby "Jack Ruby"). Ruby was convicted of Oswald's murder, though it was later overturned on appeal, and Ruby died in prison in 1967 while awaiting a new trial.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-JFKhistory-74)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-JFKDOTP-75)

In 1964, after a 10-month investigation into the assassination, the [Warren Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Commission "Warren Commission") concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, speculation over "what really happened" on November 22, 1963, in Dallas captured the public imagination during the decades that followed. Polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found that as many as 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a [criminal conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(criminal) "Conspiracy (criminal)") or [cover-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-up "Cover-up").[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-76) Numerous books, films, television specials and websites have examined the assassination in minute detail, and numerous [conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_conspiracy_theories "John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories") have been advanced. Parties as varied as the [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency"), the [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mafia "American Mafia"), the [Cuban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Cuba "Politics of Cuba") and the [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Soviet_Union "Government of the Soviet Union") governments, along with Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson, have been identified as [Suspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect "Suspect").[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-77)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-78) In an article published prior to the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, author [Vincent Bugliosi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Bugliosi "Vincent Bugliosi") estimates that a total of 42 groups, 82 assassins, and 214 people have been accused in conspiracy theories challenging the "lone gunman" theory.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office#cite_note-79)
