Explanation

The correct answer is Eleanor Roosevelt, as her maiden name 

 coincides with her husband's last name, Roosevelt. 

 Franklin Pierce, the 14th U.S. president, shares his last name with Eleanor's maiden name.

Explanation
-----------

The former U.S. First Lady whose maiden name is the same as the last name of the 14th U.S. president is Eleanor Roosevelt.

Eleanor Roosevelt was born on October 11, 1884, and her maiden name is indeed Roosevelt. She became the First Lady of the United States when her husband, Franklin D. Roosevelt, was elected as President. Franklin Pierce, the 14th U.S. president, served from 1853 to 1857, and his last name, Pierce, does not match with Eleanor's maiden name.

Eleanor played a significant role in American politics and social advocacy. Not only did she support her husband during his presidency, but she also took on her own mantle as a political activist, advocating for civil rights, women’s rights, and humanitarian causes. Her life was marked by her efforts to redefine the role of First Lady, which she accomplished through public speaking, writing, and engaging in social issues.

Eleanor Roosevelt is often remembered for her impactful work even after her husband passed away in 1945, including her role in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Overall, Eleanor Roosevelt is a prominent figure in history due to her contributions and her advocacy for social change.

Examples & Evidence
-------------------

For example, Eleanor Roosevelt transformed the role of the First Lady by actively participating in social issues and promoting human rights.

Eleanor Roosevelt's involvement in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a key piece of historical evidence showcasing her significant impact.
